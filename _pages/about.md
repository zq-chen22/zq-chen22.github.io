I am an undergraduate student in [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/ybbks/ybpy.htm), the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University. 

I’ve consistently worked in 3DCIVI lab since sophomore year, under the supervision of Prof. [Li Yi](https://ericyi.github.io/). I have completed internships at [Galaxy General Robotics](https://www.galbot.com/) and the University of Massachusetts. View my publications [here](/publications/).

**Research Interests**
My prior work has mainly explored the field of human-robot interaction and embodied AI. Recently, my research interests have focused on complex loco-manipulation tasks in humanoid robotics. 

**Misc.**
Poems I write often encourage me in difficult times — for example, the following one written before the 2021 Chinese Mathematics Olympiad.   

历雪不知寒，寻花曾越山。<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"> *(Through snow only to forget the cold, For blooms roaming the Mount bold.)* </span>   
老僧执钝剑，只影破绝关。<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"> *(Even sword blunted and ages old, The monk did break the final stronghold.)* </span>
